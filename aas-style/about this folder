Files in the aas-style folder use my modified aastex631.cls file and other formatting files that are compatible. 

The .cls file should not be used for publication preparation to be submitted to any journal requiring the AAS-style, as newer versions are now available, but this .cls file is fine for writing proposals and other documents that have no LaTex template.
